# Receipt-Scan-Sustainable-Spend


Our daily purchases hold hidden environmental costs. From plastic-packaged snacks to unnecessary travel, each item on a receipt adds to our ecological footprint. But deciphering these costs is like navigating a jungle of paper slips â€“ time-consuming and confusing. This lack of transparency creates a disconnect between our choices and their impact, hindering our ability to make informed decisions for a healthier planet. We need a solution to unveil the hidden story behind our purchases, empowering us to act as conscious consumers and build a more sustainable future.
